# TextKitAutoCompletion

Extends TextKit's default auto-completion to support live typing suggestions.

TextKit's auto-completion can be invoked in any `NSTextView` via <kbd>F5</kbd> or <kbd>‚å•</kbd>+<kbd>ESC</kbd>. It shows dictionary suggestions for the relevant word at point; but you cannot type-to-complete. Typing cancels the completion UI, so you need to hit the invocation key again after you finished typing.

This package fixes that.
